## Next Steps for Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Update `.firebaserc` with your actual Firebase project ID
4. Update `.env.local` with your Firebase project configuration

### Deployment Process
1. **Verify setup**: `./verify-deployment.sh`
2. **Set up Google Service Account** for API access (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets)
3. **Configure Firebase Functions**: 
   ```bash
   firebase functions:config:set google.credentials="$(cat service-account.json)"
   ```
4. **Deploy Functions**:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```
5. **Update environment** with deployed URL:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_URL=https://[region]-[project-id].cloudfunctions.net/api
   ```
6. **Test all functionality** with `npm run dev`

## API Endpoints Available
All original functionality preserved:
- `POST /api` with `action: "health"` - Health check
- `POST /api` with `action: "listEmails"` - Gmail integration  
- `POST /api` with `action: "listCalendar"` - Calendar events

- 🔒 **Enhanced Security**: Service account authentication, environment variables
- 📊 **Improved Monitoring**: Firebase Functions logging and analytics
- 💻 **Developer Experience**: TypeScript support, version control, CI/CD ready
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: Better error handling, structured code, automated deployment

## Files Modified
- `lib/rebeccaConfig.ts` - Backend URL configuration updated
- `verify-deployment.sh` - Enhanced deployment verification
- `FIREBASE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - Migration tracking (renamed from BRANCH_SYNC_STATUS.md)
- `.env.local` - Environment template (gitignored)
- `/backend-legacy-apps-script/` - Archived legacy code with migration notices
